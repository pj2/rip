rip
===

An implementation of the Routing Information Protocol, written as part of a university assignment.

The program will propagate a mock subnet to nearby routers. It can also receive and store routing information from other routers operating the RIPv1 / RIPv2 protocol. It does not implement route poisoning / split horizon.

Some code provided by Andrew Scott of Lancaster University.
